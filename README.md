# SVG files for Laser cutting

Cut up **three** layers of thin material that serve as **top** of the stairs.
They overlap each other by **two thirds** of their width.

Cut up **one** layer of thick material, minimum 12 mm, to serve as the walls of
the stairs. LED strips will be stuck against them facing the inside.

## Arrangement
